# NiStan

This project provides a stripped-down implementation of the advanced Bayesian models from Westfall & Yarkoni (2017). It is important to note that this code is designed for simulating data and verifying the appropriateness of model fitting, but it does not serve as a complete replication of the paper or the software used for inference via Stan. The original paper leveraged access to a supercomputer, which I do not have and do not intend to acquire for a full replication.

However, this implementation serves as a valuable resource for researchers who wish to fit time-series models in line with the methods presented in the paper. Researchers can use and adapt these Stan files for their own data at the ROI (Region of Interest) level, should they choose to do so.
