# NiStan

The following is stripped down Stan implementation project of the advanced Bayesian models presented by Westfall & Yarkoni (2017). Of importasnt note this is code to simualate data and confirm approapriate model fitting this is not a complete replaition of the paper and software using stan for infernence. The orignal paper had access to supercomputer of which i do not have nor the desire to acquuire for a fuller replication. However, this is a resource that reseeacher can use to fit timesereis models in line with said paper at the ROI level for own data if they so wish using and adapting the Stan files if they so wish.
